abstract: "We compared catches of Mysis diluviana in 80 vertical tows with large (1.0m diameter) and small (0.5m diameter) plankton nets to determine if the small net could be used in long-term monitoring historically conducted with the large net. Both nets were constructed of 500-μm aperture mesh and were towed simultaneously at 0.4m/s. Comparisons were made at each of 10 stations on three occasions during July–September, 2014 at Dillon Reservoir, Colorado. Estimates of abundance and sex ratio were not different between the two nets but the larger net sampled a slightly broader range of sizes than the smaller net. We conclude that for most population monitoring purposes, the two nets can be used interchangeably; the smaller net is more useful for studies with gear size and weight constraints, but the larger net provides a four times larger sample size and thus may be better for detecting rare individuals."
